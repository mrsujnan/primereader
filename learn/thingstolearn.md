# Creating a PDF and EPUB Reader App in C for Linux

## 1. Understand the Basics

### a. Programming in C

- Ensure you are comfortable with:
  - File handling
  - Memory management (`malloc`/`free`)
  - Pointers
- Understand basic data structures (e.g., linked lists, stacks) for parsing and rendering.

### b. Linux Development

- Familiarize yourself with:
  - Linux system calls and APIs
  - Build tools like `make` or `CMake`
  - Dynamic and static library linking

---

## 2. Knowledge of File Formats

### a. PDF

- Study the PDF format specification (provided by Adobe).
- Understand its structure:
  - Objects (text, images, fonts)
  - Compression
  - Rendering

### b. EPUB

- EPUB files are ZIP archives containing:
  - XHTML
  - CSS
  - Metadata (e.g., `content.opf`)
- Learn about XML and XHTML parsing for handling EPUBs.

## 3. Libraries to Help You

Instead of reinventing the wheel, use libraries for PDF and EPUB parsing:

### a. For PDF

- [Poppler](https://poppler.freedesktop.org/): Open-source PDF rendering library.
- [MuPDF](https://mupdf.com/): Lightweight and fast PDF library.

### b. For EPUB

- [libepub](https://github.com/libepub/libepub): A library for parsing EPUB files.
- [libxml2](http://xmlsoft.org/): Useful for XML parsing.

---

## 4. Graphics Rendering

PDFs and EPUBs often require rendering content on the screen.

### a. Graphics Libraries

- [Cairo](https://www.cairographics.org/): 2D graphics library for rendering text and images.
- [GTK](https://www.gtk.org/): For creating a graphical user interface (GUI).

### b. Text Layout

- [Pango](https://pango.gnome.org/): For text layout and rendering.

---

## 5. File Handling

- Learn how to open, read, and extract content from ZIP files (for EPUB).
- Use libraries like:
  - [zlib](https://zlib.net/)
  - [libzip](https://libzip.org/)

---

## 6. User Interface Design

Decide on the app type:

- **CLI-based**: Suitable for minimalistic tools (use `ncurses` for better TUI).
- **GUI-based**: Use frameworks like GTK, Qt, or SDL2.

---

## 7. Learn About Fonts and Text Rendering

- Understand font management (TrueType, OpenType).
- Use libraries like [FreeType](https://freetype.org/) to render text glyphs.

---

## 8. Error Handling and Robustness

- PDFs and EPUBs can be malformed or incomplete. Make your app robust by handling errors gracefully.
- Use logging (e.g., with `syslog` or a custom logger).

---

## 9. Testing and Debugging Tools

- Use tools like:
  - `gdb` for debugging
  - `valgrind` for detecting memory leaks
- Write unit tests for critical parts of your app.

---

## 10. Package Distribution

- Learn how to package your app for Linux distributions:
  - Create `.deb` or `.rpm` packages.
  - Write a `README` or man pages.

---

## Suggested Starting Steps

1. Write a CLI tool that can:
   - Extract metadata from PDFs and EPUBs.
   - Display raw content in the terminal.
2. Add basic rendering support using a library like Cairo.
3. Gradually expand to support images, links, and proper text layout.
4. Build a GUI interface once core functionality is stable.

## Useful Libraries

- **PDF**: Poppler, MuPDF
- **EPUB**: libepub, libxml2
- **Graphics**: Cairo, GTK, Pango
- **Fonts**: FreeType
- **File Handling**: zlib, libzip
- **TUI**: ncurses
- **GUI**: GTK, Qt, SDL2
